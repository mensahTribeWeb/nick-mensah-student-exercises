    A nearby airport has an incoming flight from Local Jetways. As the passengers disembark, the gate

    Implement the logic to generate a seating chart using the required number of seats. Make sure to indicate
    that each seat is initially available (TRUE).

    Note: The number of seats is guaranteed not to be negative.

    Examples:
    generateSeatingChart(7) → [true, true, true, true, true, true, true]

    getAvailableSeatCount([true, true, true, false]) → 3
