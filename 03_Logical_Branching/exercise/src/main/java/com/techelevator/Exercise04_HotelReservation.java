    The owners of Innovator's Inn realized weekends are more popular than weekdays. Because of this,

    If a guest is staying 3 or more nights, the weekday rate is still $89.99 per night. Otherwise,
     the $99.99 rate applies.
    Implement the logic to return the total amount of the stay based on the total number of nights
    and the number of weekend nights.

    calculateStayTotal(2, 0) ➔ 199.98

    calculateStayTotal(3, 0) ➔ 269.97
