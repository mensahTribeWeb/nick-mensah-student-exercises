    On further research, customers with renewable energy can put electricity back into the system.
    Tech Electric wants to give credit to these customers, subtracting the units returned from
    the units they've used.

    Implement the logic to calculate what a customer owes for the units they've used,
    and the units returned.

    Note: If a customer returns more than they used, they'll receive money back.
    The refund is a rate of $0.20 per unit regardless of the amount.
    Don't apply the 5% discount if the customer receives a refund.

    Examples:
    calculateElectricBill(50, 0) ➔ 10.0
    calculateElectricBill(50, 4) ➔ 8.74
    calculateElectricBill(50, 60) ➔ -2.0
